Design Document
Major Moving Parts of Your Design
* Motors: Dual 1000W hub motors located in the rear wheels.
* Battery Pack: A 10,000mAh lithium-ion battery.
* Wheels: 85mm wheels with a soft polyurethane coating for smooth rides.
* Deck: A flexible 7-layer bamboo and carbon fiber deck.
* Braking System: Regenerative braking that feeds energy back into the battery.
Sections / Block Diagram Create a block diagram showing the main sections of your system:
* Power Supply: Battery, Charger
* Motor Controllers: Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) connected to the motors
* User Interface: Bluetooth connection to mobile app, remote control
* Braking System: Integrated into the motor control
* Sensors: Speed sensor, battery level sensor
Priorities and Dependencies
* Priority 1: Power supply design (battery capacity, charging system).
   * Dependency: The motors depend on an adequate power supply.
* Priority 2: Motor control (ESC selection and configuration).
   * Dependency: Motor control is linked to the battery and throttle input.
* Priority 3: User interface design (app integration, remote).
   * Dependency: UI depends on the motor and ESC functioning properly.
* Priority 4: Braking system integration (regenerative braking).
   * Dependency: Depends on the motor control system being operational.
Design Approaches for Major Moving Parts
